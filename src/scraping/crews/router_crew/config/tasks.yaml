router_task:
  description: >
    Analyze the file located in the final segment of the provided path: {scraped_data_path}.
    Extract and return ONLY the file extension (e.g., 'csv', 'json', 'txt') without the dot.
    Do not return the full filename — only the extension itself.

  expected_output: >
    A single word representing the detected file extension (e.g., csv, json, txt). 
    The output MUST NOT be empty. 
    If no extension is found, return the word "unknown" instead of leaving the output blank.
