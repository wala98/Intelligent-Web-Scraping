  description : >
    Given a {website_url}, load the page, extract its HTML content, and analyze the page layout.
    Detect patterns such as repeating content blocks (cards, rows, tables) and identify what kind of useful information
    is contained in those blocks (e.g., job titles, product names, prices, contact info, images, etc.).
 
    Your analysis should :
    - Identify key scrapable content
    - Describe how it is structured (e.g., repeated divs, table rows)
    - Mention relevant HTML tags or classes to locate the content
    - Be domain-agnostic (works for e-commerce, jobs, schools, etc.)

  expected_output : > 

    A natural language summary. Clearly state what kind of information can be extracted from the website.
    Format your answer like : 
    'After analyzing the website {website_url}, here’s what information can be scraped: 
    [item1]\n , [item2]\n, [item3]\n, ...'

    Only include the most useful or frequently repeated elements, and keep the phrasing user-friendly.
    Be concise and to the point.
